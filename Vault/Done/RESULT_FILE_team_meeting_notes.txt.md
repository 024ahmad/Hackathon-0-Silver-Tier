# Processing Result: FILE_team_meeting_notes.txt.md

## Summary
A team meeting notes file was dropped into the Inbox. The file contains minimal placeholder content ("Second file") — likely a test drop or an incomplete document.

## What Was Inspected
- **Task file**: `Needs_Action/FILE_team_meeting_notes.txt.md` (YAML frontmatter parsed)
- **Related artifact**: `Needs_Action/FILE_team_meeting_notes.txt` (contents reviewed — minimal/test data)
- **Frontmatter**: type=file_drop, source=inbox, priority=normal, status=pending, needs_human_approval=false

## Suggested Next Steps
- [ ] Human: Confirm if this was a test file or if real meeting notes should be added
- [ ] If real: replace contents with actual meeting notes and re-submit
- [ ] If test: no further action required

## Risks / Approvals Needed
- **None**: No sensitive data, no financial or external actions involved.
- **Bronze limitation**: No external action taken; review-and-stage only.

## Completion Note
In Bronze context, this task is considered "Done" because: the file was reviewed, its contents were assessed (identified as minimal/test data), next steps were documented, and no external or irreversible action was attempted. The original artifact remains in Needs_Action for future reference.
